# Milestone 3

### Dineth:
 - No help was used other than the Rain and Snow textures taken from the minecraft default texture pack, the lecture, and Worley noise functions from lecture and HW4.

### Thomas:
 - No other resources were used, relied on noise functions previously shown in class or previously implemented in this assignment or ShaderFun

### Kevin:
 - Adam Mally's raytraced sky code was used as a base and modified to create a time-based skybox
 - Dineth helped me fix an issue with my far clip plane by manually setting the depth buffer before drawing the skybox

# Milestone 2

### Multithreading
 - No help was used for multithreading other than what was used in the lectures and the demo code examples provided that showcased how multithreading work. Professor Mally's code structure shown in lecture was used to create multithreading for this milestone.

### Texturing
 - Lecture recordings
 - Jackie Li helped me load minecraft_textures_all into my GPU
 - Thomas Shaw resolved some logic surrounding inaccurate UV coordinates
 - Lots of references to OpenGLFun

### Cave Generation
 - Adam's code shown in lecture, and the provided `framebuffer.h`/`cpp` files
 - [Noise functions gist](https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/670c22f3966e662d2f83)
